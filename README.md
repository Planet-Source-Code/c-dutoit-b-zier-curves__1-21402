### Description

Ever wondered on how to draw Bézier curves ?

well, here is a recursive method that let you move control points and define the depth of recursivity.

Really help to understand how it works, ever if you don't know the theory about it
 
### More Info
 
Bézier curves are use in infographie (3D, ...).

By defining 4 points of control, a bezier curve go from the first point to the last point and betwen by going indirection of intermediate points (see picture, a picture is better than thousand explanations)
